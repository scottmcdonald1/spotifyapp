# Spotify App (working title)

## The Goal 

The goal of this project was to create an App that integrated the Spotify API for the [devjam](https://devjam.vercel.app/project/Spotify-API-11) Discord group. This is a unique project for the discord group as it has no provided user stories for an MVP, instead the guideline for the project was simply to create an app using the Spotify API. This is my third project with the devjam group.

My partner works for a small record label in the Americana/Folk/Country music scene, and through conversations with her, I came up with an idea for the app -- a utility for professionals in the music industry for accessing information about artists and songs through use of the Spotify API (mostly ISRC codes). In it's essence, it is an accessible app for navigating music data with an easy-to-use user-interface.

## Live Demo 

This project is still in the early phases of production so there is no live demo at this point in time.

## User Stories

The initial concept for the app came from a coding challenge via the [devjam](https://devjam.vercel.app/project/Spotify-API-11) group, as there were no user stories provided for an MVP we were free to come up with our own:

### ðŸ“” User Stories:
1. âœ… A user can login with their spotify account.
2. âœ… A user can search by artist or song name and a table will be displayed holding all information related to the current search query.
3. [] A user can click on a provided artist, album, or song within the provided table to see a detailed view of the song's information.
4. âœ… A user can specify their query by searching in categories such as by artist or song.
